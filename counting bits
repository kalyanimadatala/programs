  class Solution:
   def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        result=[]
        for i in range(n+1):
            result.append(bin(i).count('1'))
        return result

    *********

Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]

    0--> 0000 = 0
    1--> 0001 = 1
    2--> 0010 = 1
    
    Iterate from 0 to n: Loop through each number from 0 to n.
Convert to Binary: Use the bin() function to get the binary representation of the number. For example, bin(2) returns '0b10'.
Count 1s: Use the count('1') method to count the number of 1s in the binary string.
Store the Result: Append the count to the result list.
Return the Result: After the loop, return the result list containing the counts of 1s for each number from 0 to n
